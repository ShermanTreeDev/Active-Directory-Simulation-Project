# Active Directory Homelab üñ•Ô∏è

## Project Overview üíª
This home lab project is designed to teach how to set up a Windows Active Directory (AD) environment, create users, and integrate it with Splunk to monitor activities and collect security-related logs using Sysmon and the Splunk Universal Forwarder.

The lab simulates a small enterprise network where all devices are part of a local domain and monitored by a centralized Splunk server.
